# About This Website
The goal of this website is (at least) two-fold:

  - **To accrue** different methods related to PCR (mostly qPCR and ddPCR). Having a huge library of papers on *eg.* Zotero is great! However, you can only remember so many publications of the top of your head without some sort of indexing and/or advanced sorting. Besides, I am primarily interested in ways to utilize different oligo designs and multiple methodologies/approaches to solve a particular issue, related to nucleic acid amplification/detection. Thus, a method-based library that is readily accessible via a browser (rather than some piece of software) and pre-digested is an obviously superior way to document/keep/remember/look-up different methodologies!

  - **To serve as a reference** to people starting out with their qPCR/ddPCR experiments. There's just so much information out there and it's all rather scattered across different websites, publications, blogs, *etc.* Wouldn't it be great to have an *in silico* place where you could find directions to resources to get you inspired to *I.* come up with new ideas or apply the existing ones in your field of research and then *II.* design your next ddPCR experiment? I realize the irony behind creating yet *another* website/blog on a niche subject, however the motto I follow is - *Some data is always better than no data* (JH).
